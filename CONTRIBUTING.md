## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to @monacodelisa.


## Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.
Instead, we recommend using Stack Overflow to ask support-related questions. 

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github].
Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request-pr) with a fix.


## Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
  This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

  **Note**: Adding a new topic to the documentation, or significantly re-writing a topic, counts as a major feature.

* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request-pr).


## Submission Guidelines


### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker. An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it.
In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproduction.
Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

A minimal reproduction allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out a coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem.

We require a minimal reproduction to save maintainers' time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs.
Often, developers find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal reproduction.
We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essential bits of code from a larger codebase, but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

You can file new issues by selecting from our [new issue templates](https://github.com/monacodelisa/angular-headless-hashnode/issues/new/choose) and filling out the issue template.


### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

1. Search [GitHub](https://github.com/monacodelisa/angular-headless-hashnode/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.
   You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.

2. Be sure that an issue describes the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
   Discussing the design upfront helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.

3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the `monacodelisa/angular-headles-hashnopde` repo.

4. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch develop
     ```
### default branch is develop

5. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.

6. Follow our [Coding Rules](#coding-rules).

7. Run the full Angular test suite, as described in the [developer documentation][dev-doc], and ensure that all tests pass.

8. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.
   Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

     ```shell
     git commit --all
     ```
    Note: the optional commit `--all` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

9. Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

10. In GitHub, send a pull request to `angular-headless-hashnode:develop`.

### Reviewing a Pull Request

I reserve the right not to accept pull requests from community members who haven't been good citizens of the community.

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!


#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

* Check out the develop branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout develop -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

* Update your local `develop` with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream develop
    ```


## Coding Rules
To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* All public API methods **must be documented**.
* We follow [Google's JavaScript Style Guide][js-style-guide], but wrap all code at **100 characters**.

   An automated formatter is available, see [DEVELOPER.md](docs/DEVELOPER.md#clang-format).


### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
